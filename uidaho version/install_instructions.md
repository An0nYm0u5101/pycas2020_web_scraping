## Webscraping Tools to Download for the Workshop


### Install Python Libraries

* `beautifulsoup4`
* `requests`
* `selenium`
* `json`
* `pandas`
* `re`

(`re` is optional but helpful for processing text with regex)

Here's a [bit on installation into different environments](https://snarky.ca/why-you-should-use-python-m-pip/).

### Install a Selenium Webdriver

You will also need to install a web driver for your preferred web browser.

You can do that [here](https://www.selenium.dev/downloads/). Scroll down to the "Platforms Supported by Selenium" and choose one (I use Firefox). It is  an .exe file. Save that somewhere on your system and remember where it is located.
